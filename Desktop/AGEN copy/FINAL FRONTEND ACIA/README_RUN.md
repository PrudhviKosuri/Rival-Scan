# How to Run the Application

If you see "Site cannot be reached", it means the local development server is not running.

## 1. Start the Server
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 2. Open in Browser
Once the server starts, you will see a URL like `http://localhost:5173`. Open this in your browser.

## Troubleshooting
- If the port 5173 is in use, Vite will try 5174, etc. Check the terminal output.
- Ensure you have installed dependencies: `npm install`.
